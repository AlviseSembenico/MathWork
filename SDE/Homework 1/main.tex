\section{Exercise 1}


\section{Exercise 2}
In this exercise we will prove the following equality:
\begin{equation}
    \int_0^T t \, dW(t) = T W(T) - \int_0^T W(t) \, dt
\end{equation}
Look at the left hand side, by taking it's forward Euler we obtain
\begin{equation}
    I_1 = \int _0^T t dW(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} t_n (W(t_{n-1} -W(t_n) )).
\end{equation}
Applying the hint, i.e. using the Abel's summation by parts we get
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} t_n (W(t_{n-1} -W(t_n) )) & = t_N W(t_N) - t_0 W(t_0) - \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} W(t_k) (t_k - t_{k-1}) \\
                                               & = T W(T)  - \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} W(t_k) (t_k - t_{k-1}).
\end{align*}
What is left to prove is the convergence in \(L_2\) of the right hand side, i.e. the following equation.
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(   \int _0^T W(t)dt-\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} W(t_k) (t_k - t_{k-1})  \right)^2\right] =0.
\end{equation}
Let's fix \(t_n - t_{n-1} = \Delta t\) for every \(n\geq 0\).
Using the linearity of the integral, we can rewrite it as follows
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E} \left[ \left( \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}  \int _{t_{n-1}}^{t_n} W(t)dt-\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} W(t_k) (t_k - t_{k-1}) \right) ^2  \right] & = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(   \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}  \int _{t_{n-1}}^{t_n} W(t)-W(t_n)dt  \right)^2 \right] \\
                                                                                                                                        & =\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \mathbb{E} \left[  \int _{t_{n-1}}^{t_n} W(t)-W(t_n) dt \right]                     \\
                                                                                                                                        & = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \mathbb{E} \left[  e_n ^2 \right].
\end{align*}
Where \(e_n\) is n-th error term. Moreover, in the last equation we dropped the cross terms  since \(\mathbb{E} \left[ e_i e_j \right] = 0 \) by the properties of the Brownian motion.

Next, we compute \(\mathbb{E} \left[ e_n^2 \right]\) for every \(n \geq 0\).

\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E} \left[ e_n^2 \right] & = \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(  \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1}} W(t)- W(t_n)dt  \right)^2\right]                                                         \\
                                    & = \mathbb{E} \left[  \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \left( W(t)-W(t_n)dt \right)\left( W(t)- W(t_n)ds \right)   \right]     \\
                                    & = \mathbb{E} \left[  \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \left( W(t)-W(t_n) \right)\left( W(t)- W(t_n) \right) dt ds   \right] . \\
\end{align*}
Where we used twice Fubini's Theorem. We also use Fubini for the following equality.

\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E} \left[  \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \left( W(t)-W(t_n) \right)\left( W(t)- W(t_n) \right) dt ds   \right] & =  \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \int _{t_n}^{t_{n-1} } \mathbb{E} \left[  \left( W(t)-W(t_n) \right)\left( W(t)- W(t_n) \right) dt ds   \right]
\end{align*}
